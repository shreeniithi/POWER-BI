# POWER-BI 
some points that I used to create this dashboard:

I downloaded the dataset and uploaded the data using the "Get Data" option in
Power BI. Then, I utilized the "Transform" option to check for any null values
in the dataset.
This first page provides an overview of all the four dashboards I created. The second
page includes the demographic insights, the third page focuses on turnover analysis 1, the
fourth page on turnover analysis 2, and the final page is dedicated to employee wellness.
Using the "Format Visual" option, you can customize the design of the card as
needed.
Using data groups for making better visuals. Using groups, you
can aggregate certain values together to form meaningful subsets.
The "Performance Rating" column with values 3 and 4 has been
grouped and modified to "Low" and "High" accordingly
Total attrition by environmental satisfaction.
• Environmental satisfaction is rated on a scale ranging from 1 to 4.
• On the satisfaction scale, 1 represents "very dissatisfied," 2 stands
for "dissatisfied," 3 signifies "satisfied," and 4 indicates "very
satisfied."

**In this dashboard, grouping plays a crucial role in organizing and
presenting the data effectively. The design of the dashboard is
tailored to utilize the power of grouping for enhanced data
visualization and analysis.**
